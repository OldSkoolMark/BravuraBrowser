<p>
Bravura is the first SMuFL-compliant music font and is available under the SIL Open Font License.
 This application aids Android developers of music applications by providing the ability to display Bravura glyphs in a range of sizes. 
</p>
<p>
The items in the navigation drawer list correspond to the glyph ranges specified in the ranges.json file that is part of the SMuFL specification. The search action applies to either glyph names or unicode codepoint values. Any Java regular expression can be used as a query. Queries prefixed by "U+" or "u+" are interpreted as codepoint searches, all others as glyph name searches. 
</p>
<p>
Glyphs selected via the navigation bar or search action are displayed in a GridView. Selections from this view are displayed singly in a detail view along with ascent, baseline, descent, and start font metrics.
</p>
<p>
The settings action allows you to select font (either Bravura or BravuraText), and to seperately specify font sizes for the GridView and detail views.
